# TUI Navigation and Consistency Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Arrow Keys and Space Bar Navigation
**Problem**: Arrow keys and space bar were not working due to a bug in the `key_matches` function.

**Fix**: Updated `lib/tui/utils.py`:
- Fixed `key_matches` to only use `chr()` for printable ASCII (32-126)
- Properly handle special keys by their parsed names
- Arrow keys (259-261) now work correctly

### 2. ✅ ESC Key Handling and Exit Flow
**Problem**: ESC wasn't properly exiting and aborting workflows.

**Fix**: Updated `lib/tui/unified_menu.py`:
- Changed `run()` to return exit codes (0 for success, 1 for cancel)
- ESC now properly quits with cancel status
- Multiple ESC presses handled gracefully

### 3. ✅ Fresh Install Abort Flow
**Problem**: When user pressed ESC in Fresh Install, the installation continued anyway.

**Fix**: Updated `setup.sh`:
- `fresh_install()` now checks return code from `run_configuration_wizard()`
- If user cancels (exit code != 0), the function returns immediately
- No more unwanted continuation to Ansible playbooks

### 4. ✅ Inconsistent Menus
**Problem**: Different menus used different TUI systems (MenuDialog, SelectionOverlay, etc.)

**Fixes**:
- Created `lib/tui/main_menu.py` - Unified main menu with splash screen
- Created `lib/tui/section_selector.py` - Unified section selector for Modify Setup
- Updated `show_ubootu_splash()` to use unified main menu
- Updated `modify_setup()` to use unified section selector
- All menus now use the same rendering engine

### 5. ✅ Consistent Visual Style
All menus now have:
- Same box drawing characters (single-line: ┌─┐)
- Same selection indicators ([X] for selected, [ ] for unselected)
- Same help bar at bottom
- Same navigation keys
- Same visual layout
